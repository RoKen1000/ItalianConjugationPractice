# LanguagePractice

This is currently a work in progress project I am working on to help with learning Italian cojugations. This was inspired by a website I found many years ago who's name I have forgotten that had a similar form system to learn Latin verb conjugations and noun declinations.

This project uses C#, ASP.NET, JQuery, Entity Framework Core, HTML and CSS.
